## Project Reticle Dodge (PRD)

This is the original 9 hour game jam version of the game, Project RD. Permission is granted to study the methods, tools, and assets (in all forms present) used here but NOT to use them to create any game which could be reasonably considered a clone or copy of this game or any of its future versions. Please buy the game on the itch.io link provided and you will be able to play each version of the game upon its updated releases.

You may feel free to make use of any scripts (but not any of my prefabs or any other assets) in this project in your own projects, provided you follow the above instructions, include a link to argzero.org somewhere visible in your game / project page indicating our contribution to your project, and use our logo on your contributors startup fade before or while your game starts up (if you are making a game). Other assets are provided as a courtesy to you so you may see how the scripts interact with the in-game objects. Please contact us at forrest@argzero.org if you require our logo for this purpose or if this model somehow doesn't work for you. Perhaps I can offer more convenient terms under those circumstances. In the near future, we will be posting a repo with the associated logos. We hope this will help streamline this process. We will soon have a leaderboard for you to use. Please email us a screenshot at the contact below if you beat the high score of 120 points in the current version of the game on itch.io or the Android store! We are also recruiting open alpha testers for our Android version! Please contact us if you are interested! There are only 28 keys still available!
